## Woohoo, I can build a website for my website.

Frankly, I don't yet have a use for this, but it's cool to take it on a test drive for once.

### Things to remember

#### Developers - eg, me.
> Set the pre-commit hook that's available in admin to avoid issues.

#### Users -eg, me and the kids
> Run the gopass scripts to setup the models for proper MQTT usage
