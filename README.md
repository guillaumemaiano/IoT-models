# Store code for my models

## Notes
I'm currently using NodeMCU boards from LoLin. They're fickle things.

If issues, check the cable first, then verify the esp8266 optional board repository is enabled in ArduinoIDE, then verify there is no double of the libraries.

If the board spews garbage to the console, check the baudrate in the code and in the serial console.
