# Code for the ServoSkulls

## ServoSkull 001 - George

Sound-reactive system relying on an Arduino-like, Bluetooth-compatible board and a KY-038 sensor to operate two green LEDs.

## ServoSkull 002 - Basile

Camera-reliant system relying on a Raspberry-type board to operate LEDs and network operations.

## Web Interface

Very simple webpage displaying servoskulls in current operation and their status. Not sure if worth adding interactivity?
